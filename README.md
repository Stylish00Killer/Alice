# Alice WhatsApp Bot 🤖📱

**Alice** is a Node.js WhatsApp bot built using [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys).  
Designed to run directly in Termux with pairing code login, session persistence, and built-in group moderation — because relying on humans clearly wasn’t working.

## 🧹 Why Alice?

Groups get messy. People spam. Bots don’t sleep.  
Alice just does what needs to be done — without asking twice.
